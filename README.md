# Graded-reader-templates-LaTeX-
This TeX template is inteded to help people write their own graded readers with ease whilst giving them a professional appearance.

Working with *[TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/)* and *[MiKTEX](https://miktex.org/download)*
You may need to: 
- Install packages (mostly for CJK/pinyin)
- Compile with XeLaTeX (Options -> configure TeXstudio -> build tab (on left) -> default compiler: XeLaTeX)



**Please make requests or report issues with the GitHub "Issue" tool. Thanks!**

TODO: 
Check which packages I've used and need to give credit to their authors for
